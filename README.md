# Ready-Player-50
Ready Player 50 was a challenge competition hosted by the CS50 team &amp; Lakera.ai. This challenge is a new version of the world-famous prompt-injection game Gandalf, specifically designed for CS50. Participants learnt about prompt engineering and, in turn, prompt-injection attacks, which can be a problem with large language models.

# Ready-Player-50
Ready Player 50 was a challenge competition hosted by the CS50 team &amp; Lakera.ai. This challenge utlised the world-famous prompt-injection game Gandalf, specifically designed for CS50. Participants learnt about prompt engineering and, in turn, prompt-injection attacks, which can be a problem with large language models.

## My Thoughts
Being able to not only gain some insight on prompt engineering and, in turn, prompt-injection attacks was a great opportunity. Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming interconnected with the technology that we use today. Keeping these secure is key as we continue to increase our reliance on them. This event provided a great foundation on the threats that LLMs can face and how to combat them. I hope to further my knowledge in this domain in the future. All in all, this was an enriching experience.
